# employee-salary

A small educational project focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It demonstrates the four main OOP principles: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

Using classes, the project creates objects that store information about company employees, including their name, base salary, and, if applicable to their position, the number of completed projects.

All this information can be displayed in the console.
